const[state,dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

What’s Happening?
We call useReducer with two things:
reducer → The function that handles state updates
initialState → The initial state value { count: 0 }
useReducer gives us two things in return:
state → The current state value (starts as { count: 0 })
dispatch → A function we can use to send actions to the reducer
